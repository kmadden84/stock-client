# FreshBooks Items React Client 0.0.1 ALPHA

A react-based front-end client, with connects to the FreshBooks API via OAuth2, as well as an "Items API" I created myself (available in a separate repo ("FreshBooks Items API).  
On clicking save, any item name pulled from FreshBooks via the API which matches any item with the same name in my API , will update that FreshBooks Item description with an updated stock quantity pulled from my API.
